# DND Character Creator - Java

## Project Description

This is a simple form based character creation system based loosely off of DnD 5e rules.

###### **_Note:_**
###### This will be a duplication of a previously created project, [DND Character Creator](https://github.com/tkm3d1a/dnd-char-creator).  The previous project was written in C++ for a class project.  I am recreating it now using Java.  The plan is to deploy it as a web application via the Spring framework and using Maven as a build system.  I will be making small updates and incorporating better practices that have been learned as well when doing the conversion.

Any new or updated features will be documented here, as well as a write-up on use.
